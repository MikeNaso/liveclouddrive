## Story behind this "crap" (I am not a developer, don't be scared)

**This is only a proof of concept**

I am planning to add OneDrive support in a project developed in nodejs, since I didn't and I don't know anything about nodejs, what will be the best way to learn some. A couple of days ago I developed this app, in order to create a virtual file system using Fuse (using node fuse bindings) and I developed a graph authentication and OneDrive connected.

You need to create a dir mnt, cache and the sqlite3 db
