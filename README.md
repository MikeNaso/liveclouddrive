## Story behind this "crap" (I am not a developper, don't be scared)

**This is only a proof of concept**

I am planning to add OneDrive support in a project developped in nodejs, since I didn't and I don't know anything about node, what will be the best way to learn some.
Couple of days ago I developped this app, in order to create a virtual file system using Fuse (using node fuse bidings) and I developped a graph authentication and onedrive connected.

You need to create a dir mnt, cache and the sqlite3 db
